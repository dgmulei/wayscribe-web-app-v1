# YOUR GUIDE TO MEDICARE PREVENTIVE SERVICES

The best way to stay healthy is to live a healthy lifestyle and prevent disease by exercising, eating well, keeping a healthy weight, and not smoking.

Medicare can help. Medicare pays for many preventive services to keep you healthy. For example, if you have Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), you can get a yearly "Wellness" visit and many other covered preventive services, like colorectal cancer screenings and mammograms. Preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best. Preventive services include exams, shots, lab tests, and screenings. They also include programs for health monitoring, and counseling and education to help you take care of your own health.

"Your Guide to Medicare's Preventive Services" isn't a legal document. Official Medicare Program legal guidance is contained in the relevant statutes, regulations and rulings.

The information in this booklet describes the Medicare Program at the time this booklet was printed. Changes may occur after printing. Visit Medicare.gov or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to get the most current information. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.

## Introduction

### Talk to your doctor or health care provider

Talk to your doctor or health care provider to find out which preventive services are right for you and how often you need them. Your doctor or health care provider may order exams or tests that Medicare doesn't cover. They also may recommend that you have tests more or less often than Medicare covers them. Medicare pays for some diagnostic tests. Your doctor or other health care provider may recommend a diagnostic test when a screening test or exam shows an abnormality. In some cases, you may have to pay for these services.

If you get a service that Medicare doesn't cover and you think it should, you may appeal this decision. To file an appeal, follow the instructions on your "Medicare Summary Notice" (MSN). For more information on filing an appeal, visit Medicare.gov/appeals, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.

Your costs for preventive services may be different if you're in a Medicare health plan, have other insurance, or see doctors or providers that don't accept assignment. Contact your plan or benefits administrator directly to find out about the costs. For more information about Medicare health plans, visit Medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/different-types-of-medicare-health-plans.

Remember–
Medicare covers the services listed in this booklet if you have Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance).

#### Part B deductible

The Part B deductible changes each year. Find out at Medicare.gov/basics/costs/medicare-costs.

#### Assignment

Assignment is an agreement by your doctor, provider, or supplier, to accept the payment amount Medicare approves for the service, and not to bill you for any more than the Medicare deductible and coinsurance.

In Original Medicare, this is the amount a doctor, or supplier that accepts assignment can be paid. It may be less than the actual amount a doctor or supplier charges. Medicare pays part of this amount and you're responsible for the difference

The yearly "Wellness" visit isn't a physical exam.

Your provider will ask you to fill out a questionnaire, called a "Health Risk Assessment," as part of this visit. Answering these questions can help you and your provider develop a personalized prevention plan to help you stay healthy and get the most out of your visit. Your visit may include:

- A review of your medical and family history.
- A review of your current providers and prescriptions.
- Routine measurements (like height, weight, and blood pressure).
- A cognitive assessment to look for signs of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.
- Personalized health advice.
- An evaluation of your risk factors for substance use disorder.
- A screening schedule (like a checklist) for appropriate preventive services.
- Advance care planning

#### Who's covered?

If you've had Medicare Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a yearly "Wellness" visit to develop or update your personalized plan to help prevent disease and disability, based on your current health and risk factors. Your provider will also perform a cognitive impairment exam.

#### How often does Medicare cover it?

Once every 12 months.

## Section 2: Preventive Services

### Yearly "Wellness" visit (continued)

#### Your costs if you have Original Medicare

You pay nothing for this visit if your doctor or other health care provider accepts assignment. The Part B deductible doesn't apply. However, you may have to pay coinsurance, and the Part B deductible may apply if your doctor or other health care provider performs additional tests or services during the same visit that Medicare doesn't cover under this preventive benefit. If Medicare doesn't cover the additional tests or services (like a routine physical exam), you may have to pay the full amount.

You don't need to have had a "Welcome to Medicare" preventive visit before getting a yearly "Wellness" visit. If you get the "Welcome to Medicare" preventive visit during your first year with Part B, you'll have to wait 12 months before you can get your first yearly "Wellness" visit.
