# **Help with Medicare Costs** **Medicare Savings Programs**

**This application is to see if you are eligible for help paying your Medicare Part B premiums, Medicare Part A premiums if you have them, or Part A or B copays or deductibles.**

**What may be covered depends on your and your spouse’s (if you are married) income.**

**If you are eligible for a Medicare Savings Program, you will also be enrolled in Medicare Part D Extra Help. Extra Help may help with prescription drug costs.** 

You can use this application to apply for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). SNAP is a federal program that helps you buy food each month. If you are interested, check the box on page 1 of the application, read the SNAP rights and responsibilities on pages 3 through 6, and sign on page 2\. Your application will then be sent automatically to the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA). You do not have to apply for the SNAP Program to be considered for the Medicare Savings Programs.

## **How much can I have in assets?**

There is no asset limit for Medicare Savings Programs in Massachusetts.

## **How much can I have in income?**

If your income is at or below the amounts listed here, you may qualify for help from one of several Medicare Savings Programs.

| You are a | Your income is at or below\* |
| :---- | :---- |
| **single individual** | **$2,935 /month** |
| **married couple** | **$3,966 /month** |

\*Income limits change each year on March 1\.  

You can find up-to-date information about income limits at [www.mass.gov/info-details/program-financial-guidelines-for-certain-masshealth-applicants-and-members](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/program-financial-guidelines-for-certain-masshealth-applicants-and-members).

There are certain deductions that MassHealth may subtract from your gross income when we calculate your countable income. These deductions are described in regulations 130 CMR 520.012 through 520.014.

## **If I am eligible for one of the Medicare Savings Programs, how do I get paid?**

If MassHealth finds that you are eligible for payment of all of your Medicare Part B premium, we will tell Medicare. 

If your Medicare Part B premium is deducted from your Social Security benefit, your Medicare premium will no longer be deducted. This means that the amount of your Social Security benefit will increase by the amount that used to be deducted to pay for your Medicare Part B premium.

If you are eligible for Medicare Part B but not yet getting it (or if you are paying your Medicare Part B premium in some other way, like getting a quarterly bill from Medicare), MassHealth will start paying this bill for you.

It will take several months for your Social Security benefit to increase or for MassHealth to start paying your Medicare bill. You will be paid back the amount you paid Medicare for your Part B premiums back to the month you became eligible for a Medicare Savings Program. You will get this refund the same way you now get your Social Security benefits.

## **When does coverage begin?**

You will get a notice in the mail about your coverage and when it starts. Your coverage may begin in the month we process your application or as early as three months before that.

If you are not eligible, the notice will give you the reason(s) you are not eligible. If you think the decision is wrong, you have the right to appeal it. Information about how to appeal is on the back of the written notice.

## **How we use your Social Security number** 

Unless one of the exceptions listed below applies, you must give us a Social Security number (SSN), or proof that one has been applied for, for every household member who is applying unless the following exceptions apply.

### **Exceptions**

You don’t have to give us an SSN or proof that one has been applied for if you or any member of your household

* has a religious exemption as described in federal law;   
* is eligible only for a nonwork SSN; or  
* is not eligible for an SSN.

We use your SSN to check information you have given us. We also use them to detect fraud, to see if anyone is getting duplicate benefits, or to see if others (a third party) should be paying for services.

We may match the SSN of anyone in your household who is applying, and anyone who has or who can get health insurance for any such persons, with the files of agencies, including the following:

* Internal Revenue Service   
* Social Security Administration  
* Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements   
* Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services   
* Registry of Motor Vehicles  
* Department of Revenue (DOR)  
* Department of Transitional Assistance  
* Department of Industrial Accidents   
* Department of Unemployment Assistance  
* Department of Veterans’ Services, Human Resources Division   
* Bureau of Special Investigations  
* Department of Public Health, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics   
* banks  
* other financial institutions

Files may also be matched with social service agencies in this state and other states, as well as computer files of insurance companies, employers, and managed care organizations. Additionally, MassHealth may get your financial records (and, if applicable, those of your household members) from banks and other financial institutions to verify your financial resources and otherwise determine your eligibility while you are a MassHealth member.

* My answers in this form are true and complete to the best of my knowledge.  
* I will give DTA information that is true and complete to the best of my knowledge during my interview and in the future.

#### ***I understand that:***

* I may also be subject to criminal prosecution for providing false information.   
* If DTA gets information from a reliable source about a change in my household, my benefit amount may change.  
* By signing this form, I give DTA permission to verify my eligibility for benefits, including:

I also give these agencies permission to share information about my household’s eligibility for benefits with DTA.

I have the right to question the information in the report. I may contact Equifax at: Equifax Workforce Solutions, 11432 Lackland Road, St. Louis, MO 63146, 1-800-996-7566 (toll free).

0. Banks, schools, government, employers, landlords, utility companies and other agencies to check if I am eligible for benefits.   
1. Electric, gas and telephone companies so I can get utility discounts. The companies cannot share my information or use it for any other purpose.   
2. The Department of Housing and Community Development to enroll me in the Heat & Eat Program. This program helps people get the most SNAP benefits possible.   
3. The Department of Early and Secondary Education so my children can get free school meals.'   
4. The Woman, Infants and Children (WIC) Program so that any children under age 5 or a pregnant woman in my household can get WIC.  
5. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), to verify my immigration status.  Information from USCIS may affect my household’s eligibility and amount of DTA benefits.   
   *Note: Even if you are not eligible for benefits due to immigration status, DTA will not report you to immigration authorities unless you show DTA a final order of deportation.*   
6. The Department of Revenue (DOR) to verify my eligibility for income-based tax credits, such as Earned Income and Limited Income, and to see if I am eligible for “No Tax Status” or hardship status.  
7. The Department of Children and Families (DCF) to coordinate services offered jointly by DTA and DCF.  

#### ***How does DTA use Social Security Numbers (SSNs)?*** 

DTA is allowed to ask for SSNs under The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011-2036) for SNAP and under M.G.L. c. 18 Section 33 for TAFDC and EAEDC. DTA uses SSNs to:

* Check the identity and eligibility of each household member I apply for through data matching programs.   
* Monitor compliance with program rules.  
8. Collect money if DTA claims I got benefits that I was not eligible for.   
9. Help law enforcement agencies catch people hiding from the law.

I understand that I do not have to give DTA the SSN of any non-citizen in my household, including myself, who does not want benefits. The income of a non-citizen may count even if the non-citizen does not get benefits.

#### ***Right to an Interpreter***

I understand that:

* I have a right to a free professional interpreter provided by DTA if I prefer to communicate in a language other than English.   
* If I have a DTA hearing, I can ask DTA to give me a free professional interpreter, or if I prefer, I can bring someone to interpret for me. If I need DTA to give me an interpreter for a hearing, I must call the Division of Hearings at least one week before the hearing date.

I understand that:

* I have the right to register to vote through DTA.   
* DTA will help me fill out the voter registration application form if I want help.   
* I can fill out the voter registration application form in private.   
* Applying to register or declining to register to vote will not affect my DTA benefits.

#### ***Employment Opportunities***

I agree that DTA may share my name and contact information with employment and training providers, including:

* SNAP Path Work providers or DTA specialists for SNAP clients; and  
* Contracted Employment and Training providers or Full Engagement Workers for TAFDC clients.

SNAP clients may voluntarily participate in education and employment training services through the SNAP Path to Work program. 

#### ***Citizenship Status***

I swear that all members of my household applying for DTA benefits are either U.S. citizens, or lawfully residing noncitizens.

### **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program** 

#### ***I understand that:***

* DTA manages the SNAP program in Massachusetts.  
* When I file an application with DTA (by phone, online, in person, or by mail or fax), DTA has 30 days from the date it got my application to decide if I am eligible.   
  * If I am eligible for expedited (emergency) SNAP, DTA has to give me SNAP and make sure I have an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card within 7 days from the date they got my application.   
  * I have a right to speak to a DTA supervisor if:  
    * DTA says I am not eligible for emergency SNAP benefits, and I disagree.   
    * I am eligible for emergency SNAP benefits, but do not get my benefits by the 7th day after I applied for SNAP.   
    * I am eligible for emergency SNAP benefits but do not get my EBT card by the 7th day after I applied for SNAP.  
* When I get SNAP, I have to meet certain rules. When I am approved for SNAP, DTA will give me a copy of the “Your Right to Know” brochure and the SNAP Program brochure. I will read the brochures or have someone read them to me.  If I have any questions or need help reading or understanding this information, I can call DTA at 1-877-382-2363.  
* **Telling DTA about changes in my household**:   
  * If I am a SNAP Simplified Reporting household, I do not have to report most changes to DTA until the Interim Report or Recertification is due. The only things I have to report sooner are:  
    * If my household’s income goes over the gross income threshold (listed on my approval notice).   
      * I have to report this by the 10th day of the month after the month my income went over the threshold.   
    * If I have to meet the Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) Work Rules and my work hours drop below 20 hours per week.   
  * If everyone in my household is 60 or older, disabled, or under 18 years old, and no one has earnings from work, the only things I have to report are:  
    * If someone starts working, or   
    * Someone joins or leaves my household.   
      * I have to report these changes by the 10th day of the month after the month of the change.   
  * If I get SNAP through Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA) because my TAFDC stopped, I do not have to report any changes to DTA for the 5 months that I get TBA.   
  * If I get SNAP through Bay State CAP, I do not have to report any changes to DTA. 

If I and everyone in my household gets cash assistance (TAFDC or EAEDC), I must report certain changes to DTA within 10 days of the change.

I may get more SNAP benefits if I report and give DTA proofs for the following, at any time: 

* Child or other dependent care costs, shelter costs, and/or utility costs;  
* Child support that I (or someone in my household) is legally required to pay to a non-household member; and  
* Medical costs for members of my household, including myself, who are 60 or older or disabled. 

**Work rules for SNAP clients**: If you get SNAP benefits and are between the ages of 16 and 59 you may need to meet general SNAP work rules or the ABAWD work rules unless you are exempt. DTA will tell me and members of my household if we need to meet any Work Rules, what the exemptions are, and what will happen if we do not meet the rules.  

If you are under the SNAP Work Rules: 

* You must register for work at application and when you recertify for SNAP. You register when you sign the SNAP application or recertification form.  
* You must give DTA information about your employment status when DTA asks.  
* You must report to an employer if referred by DTA.  
* You must accept a job offer (unless you have a good reason not to).  
* You must not quit a job of more than 30 hours a week without a good reason.  
* You must not cut your work hours to less than 30 hours a week without a good reason.

#### ***SNAP Rules***

* Do not trade or sell SNAP benefits.  
* Do not alter EBT cards to get SNAP benefits you are not eligible for.  
* Do not use SNAP benefits to buy ineligible items, such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.  
* Do not use someone else’s SNAP benefits or EBT card unless you are an authorized representative, or the recipient has given you permission to use their card on their behalf. 

#### ***SNAP Penalty Warnings***

I understand that if I or any member of my SNAP household intentionally breaks any of the rules listed above, that person will not be eligible for SNAP for *o*ne year after the first violation, two years after the second violation and forever after the third violation. That person may also be fined up to $250,000, imprisoned up to 20 years, or both. They may also be subject to prosecution under Federal and State laws. 

I also understand the following penalties. If I or a member of my SNAP household:

* Commit a **cash program** Intentional Program Violation (IPV) they will be ineligible for SNAP for the same period they are ineligible for cash assistance.

# **Authorized Representative Designation Form**

You can submit this form if you would like to designate an authorized representative to act on your behalf. If an authorized representative signed your application for you, or if you are an authorized representative applying on behalf of someone else, you MUST submit this form for the application to be processed.

You do not need to fill out this form if you live in an institution and want copies of eligibility notices sent to you and to your spouse who still lives at home. We will do that automatically.

NOTE: An authorized representative has the authority to act on an applicant's or member's behalf in all matters with MassHealth and the Health Connector, and will receive personal information about the applicant or member until we receive a cancellation notice terminating their authority, or upon the death of the applicant or member. Their authority will not automatically terminate once we process your application.

You can choose someone to help you.

You may choose an authorized representative to help you get health care coverage through programs offered by MassHealth and the Health Connector. You can do this by filling out this form (the Authorized Representative Designation Form). You or a representative can sign for yourself and for any of your dependent children under the age of 18 for whom you are the custodial parent.

You are not required to have a representative in order to apply for or receive benefits.

## **Who can help me?**

1\. An authorized representative can be a friend, family member, relative, or other person or organization of your choosing who agrees to help you. It is up to you to choose an authorized representative if you want one. Neither MassHealth nor the Health Connector will choose an authorized representative for you. You must designate in writing (fill out Section I, Part A) the person or organization who you want to be your authorized representative.

Your authorized representative must also fill out Section I, Part B. We sometimes refer to this person or organization as a “Section I authorized representative.” 

2\. If you cannot designate an authorized representative in writing and you do not have an existing authorized representative or other person who is authorized by law to act on your behalf, a person (not an organization) who certifies that they will act responsibly on your behalf can be your authorized representative if that person fills out Section II of this form. We sometimes refer to this person as a “Section II authorized representative.” 

3\. An authorized representative can also be someone who has been appointed by law to act on your behalf, or on behalf of the estate of an applicant or member who has died. This person must fill out Section III and either you or this person must submit to us, together with this form, a copy of the applicable legal document stating that this person has authority to represent you, or the estate of a deceased applicant or member. We sometimes refer to this person as a “Section III authorized representative.” 

4\. A Section III authorized representative may be a legal guardian, conservator, holder of power of attorney, or health care proxy, or, if the applicant or member has died, the personal representative of the estate. 

## **What can an authorized representative do?**

A Section I or II authorized representative may  

* fill out your application or eligibility review forms;  
* fill out other MassHealth or Health Connector eligibility or enrollment forms;  
* give proof of information reported on these forms;  
* report changes in income, address, or other circumstances;    
* get copies of all of your MassHealth and Health Connector eligibility and enrollment notices; and    
* act on your behalf in all other matters with MassHealth and the Health Connector. 

What a section III authorized representative is authorized to do for you (or for the Estate of a deceased applicant or member) will depend on the wording of the legal appointment.

Please note: Eligibility notices may include information about other members of an applicant’s or member’s household. If there are multiple people in your household we may not be able to send copies of some of your notices to your authorized representative unless each household member has also designated the same authorized representative by completing a separate Authorized Representative Designation Form.
