## Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage (Part D)

You may purchase Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage through stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) or through a Medicare Part C Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage (MAPDs). These plans have costs, including monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and copays/coinsurance.

### PDPs:
PDPs are offered by insurance companies that contract with Medicare to provide drug coverage. These plans are a good option for people who get their medical benefits through Original Medicare Parts A and B.

### MAPDs:
MAPDs are offered by insurance companies that contract with Medicare to provide members with medical benefits and prescription drug benefits (Medicare Part D). You must have Original Medicare Parts A and B to join a Medicare Advantage plan. You cannot have a Medicare Advantage plan and a stand-alone Part D plan at the same time.

## Part D Drug Coverage for 2025

You will move through stages of Part D drug coverage through the year, based on the cost of your prescription drugs. You may not move through all of the stages in a calendar year if your drugs are inexpensive.

### Deductible stage:
You may be responsible for 100% of the cost of covered drugs until you reach the annual deductible. You will move into the next stage once the deductible is met (maximum $590). Some plans eliminate the deductible; other plans only apply the deductible to brand name drugs.

### Initial coverage stage:
During this stage, the cost of drugs is shared by you and the plan. You will pay copays or coinsurance (approximately 25% of the cost of the drug), and the plan will pick up the remainder for covered drugs. Your copay or coinsurance amount is determined by what tier your drug falls in; most plans have five tiers (preferred generics, non-preferred generics, preferred brands, non-preferred brands, and specialty tier). Many plans have copays of $5 or less for preferred generic drugs!

You remain in this stage until your cumulative "true out-of-pocket costs" reach $2,000. Medicare counts every dollar that you spend on your Part D-covered drugs, and amounts paid by others may be included as well (for example, if you receive assistance through the Extra Help program). If your counted costs reach $2,000, you will not pay any additional copays for the remainder of the year.

### Coverage gap stage:
Also known informally as the "donut hole," the coverage gap was eliminated for 2025.

### Catastrophic coverage stage:
If you reach the catastrophic stage, your Part D-covered drugs will be covered at no cost to you for the rest of the calendar year.
