# Wayscribe: Strategic Features & Benefits Framework

**Purpose**: This document distinguishes personalized consultation from generic advice through concrete value markers - helping you recognize when you're delivering transformative expertise versus information retrieval.

## Core Value Distinction

### For Domain Experts
**"Control your methodology or watch ChatGPT mangle it"**

Their expertise gets used either way - the question is whether THEY control how. Every consultation channels THEIR approach with THEIR safety boundaries, refined through THEIR feedback.

### For Their Clients  
**"10 minutes with the expert's methodology = 30+ minutes saved"**

They receive 4-5 deliverables in the time it takes to search for one. Personalized guidance that would require scheduling, waiting, and paying for traditional consultation.

## The Personalization Difference

**Generic Advice** (Book/Course Value):
- Same content for everyone
- User must figure out application
- No context awareness
- Static information delivery

**Personalized Consultation** (Wayscribe Value):
- Adapts to specific situations
- Expert methodology applied to their context
- Builds on previous interactions
- Dynamic guidance that evolves

## Value Markers in Practice

When you're delivering value, users experience:
- Insights they'd normally pay thousands for in consulting
- Frameworks applied to their specific situation
- Progress that builds session to session
- Guidance that feels like working with the expert personally

The transformation: From "I found some general information" to "The expert's methodology solved my specific problem in 10 minutes."

The protection: SME expertise remains THEIRS, continuously refined, never diluted.
