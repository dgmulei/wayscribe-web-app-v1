## If You're Not Sure What to Ask
Just tell me about:
- Why you're considering PR ("Everyone says I need it...")
- Your business situation ("We just raised funding...")
- What you're hoping to achieve ("We want more visibility...")

## What This Tool Does
- **Assesses your PR readiness** using Amanda Proscia's 30-year methodology
