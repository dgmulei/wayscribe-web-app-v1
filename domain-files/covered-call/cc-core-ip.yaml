## Note: Computation Types
# This framework supports four types of quantitative methods:
# - "declarative": Direct formulas and lookups (input → formula → output)
# - "procedural": Step-by-step algorithms with branching logic
# - "iterative": Methods requiring loops until convergence
# - "stateful": Calculations that depend on historical state
#
# This covered call strategy is "declarative" because it uses pure formulas
# and lookup tables with no loops, branching, or state dependencies.
# The same YAML structure can accommodate other types by storing:
# - Procedural: algorithm steps and decision rules
# - Iterative: convergence criteria and loop structures  
# - Stateful: state variables and update rules

  tagline: "Stock Rental Income Calculator"
  elevator_pitch: "Transform long-term stock holdings into monthly cash flow using mathematically-proven 84% success rate strategies"
  target_user: "Investors who own stocks they're never selling anyway"
  value_proposition:
    - "Generate rental income from illiquid holdings"
    - "84% probability-based success rates"
    - "Mathematical precision using implied volatility"

method:
  type: quantitative
  core_principle: "Implied volatility predicts future price movement within statistical probability cones"
  
  formulas:
    expected_move:
      formula: "stock_price * (iv_percent/100) * sqrt(days/365)"

    strike_selection:
      formula: "stock_price + (expected_move * probability_multiplier)"
      description: "Target strike at desired probability level"
    
    premium_estimate:
      formula: "iv_percent * sqrt(days/365) * 0.4"

        biweekly: {days: 14, trades_per_year: 26, note: "Optimal for most retail traders"}
        monthly: {days: 30, trades_per_year: 12, note: "Lower maintenance, longer exposure"}
      risk_adjustment: "multiply base return by success probability"

      - "Above $100: round to nearest $5"
      - "Above $50: round to nearest $2.50"

    management_guidelines:
      - "Buy to close at 50% profit"
      - "Monitor for dividend assignment risk"
      - "Consider rolling 5-7 days before expiration"
