# Getting Started - Where to Begin

## If You're Not Sure What to Ask
Just tell me about:
- Your stock holdings ("I own 500 shares of...")
- Your income goals ("I want to generate $X monthly...")
- Your concerns ("I don't want to lose my shares...")

## What This Tool Does
- **Analyzes covered call opportunities** on your existing holdings
- **Recommends strike prices** based on your risk tolerance
- **Calculates potential returns** with downside protection
- **Provides exit strategies** for managing positions

## Quick Examples to Try
- "I own 1000 shares of AAPL"
- "How do covered calls work?"
- "What's the safest strike to sell?"
- "Compare 75% vs 84% probability strikes"

## How It Works
1. Share your holdings and goals
2. I'll analyze options based on probability and protection
3. You'll receive specific strike recommendations with rationale

No options expertise required - I'll guide you through conservative income generation.
