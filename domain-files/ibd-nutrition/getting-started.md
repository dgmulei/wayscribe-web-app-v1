# Getting Started - Clinical Entry Points

## If You're Not Sure Where to Start
Just tell me about:
- A patient you're seeing ("I have a patient with...")
- A nutrition question you received ("Patient asked about...")
- What you need ("I need a handout for...")

## What This Tool Does
- **Creates personalized recipe collections** matching diet phases and restrictions
- **Generates patient handouts** with diet instructions
- **Creates clinical documentation** for nutrition consultations  
- **Compares therapeutic diets** with evidence summaries
- **Provides implementation guidance** with monitoring parameters

## Quick Examples to Try
- "What dietary options exist for IBD?"
- "Show me a patient handout for SCD diet"
- "Compare SCD vs IBD-AID for my patient"
- "What recipes work for IBD-AID Phase 1?"

## How It Works
1. Describe your clinical scenario or question
2. I'll assess the situation using the 5-step framework
3. You'll receive evidence-based recommendations with practical materials

No IBD nutrition expertise required - I'll guide you through the options.
