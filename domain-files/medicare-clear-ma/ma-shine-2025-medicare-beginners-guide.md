# Medicare Beginner's Guide

Disclaimer: This guide covers the basics – and just the basics – about applying for Medicare. It does not include every detail of this complicated subject. You can contact SHINE (Serving Health Insurance Needs of Everyone) for more information. SHINE is an educational resource that is designed to inform you about the complexities of Medicare. Information was obtained via the Social Security, Medicare, and Division of Insurance websites, IRS, as well as the Medicare & You Handbook.

## Are you ready to enroll in Medicare? If so, your first step should be to contact the Social Security Administration!

If you're turning 65 in the next 3 months and not yet receiving benefits from the Social Security Administration, you will not get Medicare automatically! It is your responsibility to contact Social Security if you wish to enroll in Medicare. You will not receive any reminders or notifications from either Social Security or Medicare.

Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Medicare- If you're under 65 and have a disability, you'll automatically get Part A and Part B once you have received 24 months of SSDI payments.

Social Security manages enrollment in Parts A and B, and will review your records to see if you qualify for Medicare. They will determine if you qualify for premium-free Part A, and what your monthly premium for Part B will be, based on your income. If you have a higher income, your Part B and Part D premiums may be higher. This is known as the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). Your Part B Medicare Costs.

> NOTE: In most situations, Medicare eligibility is under a beneficiary's own social security number. However, in the event the beneficiary is collecting spousal's/widow/widower benefits, then the Medicare entitlement would be transferred to the record where the beneficiary currently collects cash benefits. The beneficiary still retains his/her own unique Medicare number which shows on their Medicare.gov account (see page 8 of this guide).

Effective January 6, 2025, SSA will require customers to schedule an appointment for service in their field offices, including requests for Social Security cards. SSA encourages customers to become accustomed to:

- online services, where many transactions can be completed conveniently and securely, and
- automated services available on the National 800# at 1-800-772-1213.

Customers who are not able to handle their business online or with the automated options, may call their local Social Security office or the National 800# to schedule an appointment.

SSA will not turn people away for service who are unable to make an appointment or do not want to make an appointment. For example, members of vulnerable populations, military personnel, people with terminal illnesses, and individuals with other situations requiring immediate or specialized attention may still walk in for service at the field offices. Some of the offices also have minimal to no wait times, and they will still serve customers who walk in.

- 1-800-772-1213; Social Security Website (www.ssa.gov)

TIP: Social Security highly recommends that you create a personalized Social Security account to enroll in Medicare

## Protection from Penalties

- Once you are eligible for Medicare, as long as you are working and covered by your employer's group health plan (or by a spouse's plan), you will not be assessed a Part B Late Enrollment penalty. You will need to provide an Employment Letter to Social Security. COBRA does not provide coverage from the Part B penalty.
- After you enroll in Medicare, if you have creditable drug coverage from any source, including employer, VA coverage, or COBRA coverage, you will not be assessed a Part D late enrollment penalty. If you lose this creditable coverage, you will have up to two months to enroll in a Medicare drug plan to avoid any penalties.

## Two Options for Medicare

Once you have enrolled in Medicare A and B via Social Security, you will have two options: (See page 9 for a comparison chart)

1) Original Medicare (Parts A & B) with an optional Medigap and/or standalone drug plan (Part D)

2) Medicare Advantage plan (also known as Medicare Part C or MA plan). *You must have Part A and Part B in order to have a MA plan.

## Medicare Medical Savings Accounts *Not Currently available in Massachusetts*

Medicare Medical Savings Accounts (MSA) are consumer-directed plans that pair high deductible coverage with a Medical Savings Account. Although these plans are considered Medicare Advantage plans, there are some important distinctions:

- MSA plans do not include Part D drug coverage. Individuals who sign up for an MSA would need to join a separate Part D plan to have drug coverage.
- There are no networks, but individuals must use providers that accept their MSA plan

(See pages 10-12 for a List of Medicare Advantage Plans Currently Offered in Massachusetts)

## Medigap Plans

Medigap plans, also known as supplements, provide extra coverage beyond Medicare by filling some of the gaps in Medicare coverage. Medigap plans do not provide prescription drug coverage.

In Massachusetts, there are 7 private insurance companies that offer supplement plans across the state. Massachusetts offers continuous open enrollment, which allows you to enroll, change or drop your plan any month for an effective date the 1st of the following month of enrollment. Medigap plans in Massachusetts are also community rated, this means the same monthly premium is charged to everyone who has the Medigap policy regardless of age or medical history.

(See pages 13-15 for a List of Medigap Plans Currently Offered in Massachusetts)
