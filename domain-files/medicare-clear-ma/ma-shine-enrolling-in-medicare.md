# Enrolling in Medicare through the Social Security Administration

To actively enroll in Medicare, contact the Social Security Administration. You can enroll through Social Security in three different ways.

## Visit your local Social Security office.
If you need to visit your local Social Security office to enroll in Medicare, you should make an appointment. Appointments are strongly recommended so that you can avoid delays and waiting in line.

Call Social Security at 800-772-1213 to make an appointment at your local office. Visit https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp to find the address for your local office.

## Enroll online.
To avoid waiting in line, consider enrolling in Medicare online. There are two ways to apply for Medicare online:

* If you are applying for Medicare Part A and Part B at the same time, you can use the online application found here: www.ssa.gov/benefits/medicare/
* If you are applying for Medicare Part B using the Part B Special Enrollment Period (SEP), you can use the online application found here: https://secure.ssa.gov/mpboa/medicare-part-b-online-application

## Enroll over the phone.
Call the Social Security Administration at 800-772-1213 to enroll in Medicare over the phone.

## Did you miss your enrollment deadline?
If you need to enroll in Medicare, but you missed your enrollment period, contact your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) for help.
