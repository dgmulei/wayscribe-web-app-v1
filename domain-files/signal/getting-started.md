# Getting Started - Where to Begin

## If You're Not Sure What to Ask
Just tell me about:
- Your product challenge ("We ship features but nothing improves...")
- Your team situation ("Product and Engineering don't align...")
- What's frustrating you ("Every customer request becomes a feature...")

## What This Tool Does
- **Diagnoses product dysfunction** using Marc Aiello's ecosystem methodology
- **Creates strategic deliverables** like vision boards and roadmaps
- **Provides implementation frameworks** for validation and alignment
- **Quantifies the cost** of your current problems

## Quick Examples to Try
- "We're a feature factory - how do we change?"
- "How do we align Product and Engineering?"
- "What's wrong with our product process?"
- "How do we know what to build?"

## How It Works
1. Share your product challenge or pain point
2. I'll diagnose using Marc's frameworks
3. You'll receive specific recommendations and tools

No product management expertise required - I'll guide you from problem to solution.
