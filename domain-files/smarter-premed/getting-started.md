# Smarter PreMed Consultation Suite - Quick Start

## How to Use This
1. Upload student materials (transcript, resume, questionnaire)
2. Ask specific questions about positioning or gaps

## Common Starting Points

**Share context and get perspective:**
"I have a student with strong research but limited clinical hours. Here's their resume - what patterns do you see?"

**Explore specific concerns together:**
"This student has a 3.7 GPA but struggled with physics. How might different cohorts view this trajectory?"

**Test strategic options:**
"I'm thinking this student needs a gap year for clinical experience. Can we explore if that's the right move based on their profile?"

**Work through complex cases:**
"I have conflicting signals - great stats but no clear narrative. Let's figure out their positioning together."

**Iterate on recommendations:**
"Based on what we've discussed, what schools make sense? Let me share what the student is thinking too..."

For the best Wayscribe experience: Work with it like a colleague. Share context, explore patterns together, and test your strategic thinking. The more you engage, the sharper the insights.
