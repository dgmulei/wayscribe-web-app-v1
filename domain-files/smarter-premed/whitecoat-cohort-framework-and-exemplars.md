Methodology & Sources

This document outlines the methodology used to classify medical schools into specific cohorts based on their educational missions and practices. The primary objective was to identify exemplar institutions that embody the core principles of each cohort, providing a useful framework for students and stakeholders interested in understanding the diversity and offerings within medical education.

The cohorts were defined based on key educational philosophies and missions. Each cohort includes specific indicators that schools must demonstrate to be classified within that group. These indicators encompass various aspects of medical education, including commitment to patient care, community engagement, research excellence, and the emphasis on health equity.

The categorization was primarily informed by an analysis of schools’ mission statements, curricular structures, community engagement initiatives, research output, and graduate outcomes. Additional qualitative data, such as student feedback and institutional publications, was also utilized to enrich the categorization process.

Selection of Representative Schools: To establish a robust list of exemplar schools within each cohort. Schools were evaluated against the defined indicators to determine their alignment with the cohort's mission.

Validation: The cohort validation methodology involved a systematic evaluation of each school against predefined criteria, including institutional indicators, applicant profile indicators, and quantitative benchmarks specific to each cohort. Each school's mission alignment was assessed by reviewing its commitment to core values such as community service, research integration, and patient-centered care.

Quantitative data were gathered, including median GPA and MCAT scores, clinical experience hours, and research engagement metrics. The validation process also encompassed checking for recognized programs, research funding levels, and student participation in impactful initiatives.

Quantitative metrics: 

- Literature Review: An extensive review of available literature concerning medical school admissions processes and benchmarks was conducted. This included official reports, guidelines, and mission statements from medical schools.

- Data Sources: Several primary data sources were consulted to gather the required metrics:
American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC): This organization's reports provided vital statistics regarding admissions trends, requirements, and metrics for various medical schools.
Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR): This comprehensive database includes detailed information on U.S. medical schools, including mission statements, program offerings, and admission metrics.
Research articles: Peer-reviewed articles were analyzed for insights into the admissions process and factors contributing to applicant success.

- Categorization: Metrics were categorized according to the defined cohorts: Mission-Driven, Patient-Centered, Community-Clinical, Clinical-Investigative, and Research-Intensive. Each cohort was evaluated against specific indicators including total clinical hours, recency and consistency of clinical experience, longitudinal patient interaction, certification choices, and setting choices.
Data Extraction:

- Specific metrics from the gathered sources were extracted and summarized based on current admissions standards and expectations. This included requirements for coursework, recommended advanced coursework, competitive research engagement, and other relevant indicators.

- Verification: The collected data was cross-referenced with multiple sources to enhance accuracy and reliability. When discrepancies arose, the most credible or frequently reported figures were prioritized.

- Synthesis: Finally, the data was synthesized into clearly defined metrics for each cohort, comparing the expected standards and attributes necessary for successful applicants.
